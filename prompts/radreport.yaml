    **Background information of the thyroid nodules**
        - thyroid nodules are nodules includes all nodules described in the report that are not parathyroid nodules or lymph nodes (e.g. level 6, lymph, etc.)
    **Background information the Radiology Report**
        - Location refers to where a nodule is situated within the thyroid gland (e.g., in the right lobe, left lobe, or isthmus).
        - Size is measured as the largest diameter in numerical value. If size has more than one dimensions (e.g. 33 x 21 x 42 mm) or described as a range (e.g. up to 2 mm), report the largest dimension value (e.g. 42 mm or 2 mm).
        - Composition refers to the internal makeup of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It describes the relative proportions of fluid, soft tissue, and sometimes even spongiform (cyst-like spaces) elements within the nodule.
        - Echogenicity refers to how bright or dark a nodule appears on ultrasound relative to the surrounding normal thyroid tissue.
        - Shape refers to the geometric configuration of a nodule. The shape is either "taller-than-wide" if taller in vertical axis and "wider-than-tall" if wider in horizontal axis.
        - Margins describe the edge or border of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It can take a value from "smooth", "ill-defined", "lobulated", "irregular", "extra-thyroidal extension". If not mentioned, return "Unknown".
        - Echogenic foci are small, bright spots within a nodule on ultrasound. If the report metions directly mentions abscent of calcification, report as "no calcifications". If the report does not mention echogenic foci of the nodule, report "Unknown"

    You are an expert medical report parser. Your task is to analyze a radiology report and extract the location of all nodules and sentences that describe each of the nodule. For each task, follow all the steps carefully:
    Copy and and paste all the setences that describe the nodule witout modification.
    The nodule description could follow either ATA guideline or TI-RADS format.

    - Step 1. Identify all nodules in the report. Do not identify lymph node, parathyroid nodule, or nodules that are grouped together (e.g. multiple nodules)
    - Step 2. For each nodule, extract the most detailed location.
    - Step 3. Copy and paste all the sentences that describe each nodules.
    - Step 4. Double check if the sentences assigned to a nodule does not belong to other nodules, parathyroid nodules or lymph nodes.
    
    Process 2. **Structure the Output in YAML:**
    - The final output should be a YAML document with a top-level key "radiology_report_nodules" and following features as second-level keys.
    - Use exactly the field names and structure as the example shown below.
    - Nodule ID should always be numerical.
    
    **Example YAML Structure:**
        radiology_report_nodules:
        -   nodule_id: '1'
            location: 'right mid gland'
            description sentences: "34 mm right mid gland in nodule, solid or almost completely (>95%) solid (2), isoechoic (1), wider-than-tall (0), smooth margins (0), with no calcifications (0), TI-RADS 3 (Total 3 points) , previously measuring 26 mm."
        -   nodule_id: '2'
            location: 'superior right gland'
            description sentences: "There is a solitary nodule measuring 7 x 5 x 7 mm in the superior right gland demonstrating heterogeneous echotexture with multiple punctate echogenic foci suspicious for microcalcifications. The margins of the nodule are somewhat poorly defined and there is no significant vascularity. ATA 2015 high suspicion pattern."

    Do not modify the information when extracting them from the reports and extract as is from the reports.
