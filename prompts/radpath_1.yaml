  **Background information the Radiology Report**
      - Location refers to where a nodule is situated within the thyroid gland (e.g., in the right lobe, left lobe, or isthmus).
      - Size is measured as the largest diameter in numerical value. If size has more than one dimensions (e.g. 33 x 21 x 42 mm) or described as a range (e.g. up to 2 mm), report the largest dimension value (e.g. 42 mm or 2 mm).
      - Composition refers to the internal makeup of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It describes the relative proportions of fluid, soft tissue, and sometimes even spongiform (cyst-like spaces) elements within the nodule.
      - Echogenicity refers to how bright or dark a nodule appears on ultrasound relative to the surrounding normal thyroid tissue.
      - Shape refers to the geometric configuration of a nodule. The shape is either "taller-than-wide" if taller in vertical axis and "wider-than-tall" if wider in horizontal axis.
      - Margins describe the edge or border of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It can take a value from "smooth", "ill-defined", "lobulated", "irregular", "extra-thyroidal extension". If not mentioned, return "Unknown".
      - Echogenic foci are small, bright spots within a nodule on ultrasound, indicating areas that strongly reflect the ultrasound waves. If the report metions directly mentions abscent of calcification, report as "no calcifications". If the report does not mention echogenic foci of the nodule, report "Unknown"
  **Background information the Biopsy Report**    
      - "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" contains the information of biopsied nodules.
      - "CLINICAL INFORMATION" contains clinical notes or radiology report results that can be used to provide more detailed information of the biopsied nodules.
      - "MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION" contains cytological findings of the biopsied samples.
  
  You are an expert medical report parser. Your task is to analyze a pair of reports—a radiology report and a biopsy report—and extract all the relevant details. 
  Always extract the texts as is from the reports without modification. Be careful not to make any inference while extracting nodule informations.
  For each task, follow all the steps carefully:
  
  Process 1. **Extract Radiology Report Nodule Details (follow each step):**
      - Step 1. identify all nodules in the report. Do not identify lymph node, parathyroid nodule, or nodules that are grouped together (e.g. multiple nodules)
      - Step 2. for each nodule, extract the most detailed location, size, composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci, TI-RADS that can be directly found (not inferred).
      - Step 3. If the information of the feature does not exist in the radiology report, report "Unknown" as the value.
      - Step 4. Check if the the extracted information actually appear in the radiology report and not modified (as is from the report).
      - Step 5. Check if each features information is assigned to the correct feature. Be careful not to mix features or add other features (e.g. not mix echogenicity and composition).
  
  Process 2. **Extract Biopsied Nodules and Lymph Nodes from Biopsy Report**
      - Step 1. Indentify all samples biopsied in the biopsy report (under "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section) and categorize them either as thyroid nodule and lymph node (e.g. level).
      - Step 2. For each biopsied thyroid nodule, extract the location and biopsy result of the nodule under "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section. (consider possible short hand writing such as 'l' for left and 'r' for right)
      - Step 3. For each biopsied lymph node, report its level information (convert to arabian number) and biopsy result only if they appear in the biopsy report.
      - Step 4. If the biopsy result is benign, report as simply "benign" but report the full description when malignent.
          (e.g. - LEFT, Benign, 
                - Right, Malignant - Papillary Carcinoma)

  Process 3. **Extract Every Location and Size within Biopsy Report outside of "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section**
      - Step 1. Make a list of all nodule location and size descriptions that can be found in the Biopsy Report outside of "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section.
          (e.g. - left mid gland, 17 mm, 
                - right mid gland, 12 mm, 
                - right inferior gland, 23 mm)
  
  Process 4.
      - Step 1. For each biopsied nodule from process 2, list all nodules and their descriptions from process 3 that can be referred to the biopsied nodule based on the explicitly mentioned location information only.
      Be careful not to make any assumptions.
          (e.g. Biopsied nodule: Right -- Other Nodule descriptions: right mid gland, 12mm, - right inferior, 23 mm
                Bipsided nodule: Left -- Other Nodule descriptions: left mid gland, 17mm)
  
  Process 5. **Update the Biopsied Nodules Location and Size Description with information from the entire biopsy report (not including radiology report)**
      - Step 1. For each biopsied nodule, follow the rule below to decide whether to replace the original location and size of the biopsied nodule (process 2) with location and size found from (process 3) - do not consider radiology report for this task.
          * Rule 1: The updating of information can only be done based on the excplicitly mentioned location information or explicit mention of biospy (e.g. subjected to FNA, recommended for FNA)
          * Rule 2: Order of the nodule in the biopsy report does not mean anything. If multiple nodules with same location was biopsied  (e.g. right and right) it does not inherently mean that the first right biopsied nodule (process 2) belongs to the first more detailed nodule description (from process 3) since both permutations are possible)
          * Rule 3: If more than one descriptions from process 3 can be referred to the original biopsied nodule (process 2) based on process 4, keep the original size and location without updating. (e.g. Right has two options, right mid and right inferior gland without a clear way to eliminate the candidates, so keep original, Right without size info)
          * Rule 5: If more than one biopsied nodule can be referred to the same nodule description from process 3, keep the original size and location without updating. (e.g. There are two right biopsied nodules, and there is one option - right inferior, 13mm, you cannot associate it to any of the biopsied nodule since it is ambiguous)
          * Rule 4: If only one descriptions from process 3 can be referred to the original biopsied nodule (process 2) based on process 4 and if the description is more detailed than the orginal description, replace the original location of biopsied nodule with location and corresponding size found in process 3. (e.g. update LEFT with left mid gland, 17 mm)
      - Step 2. Use the updated location and size for the final yaml output.
  
  Process 6. **Identify Nodule Matching:**
      Definition of match: Two nodules, each from radiology and biopsy reports can be considered identical.
      - Step 1. For each biopsied thyroid nodule (not lymph node) identify all nodules in the radiology report that can be matches based on the updated biopsied nodule desciption.
      - Step 2. If there are multiple possible radiology report nodules that can be matched to the biopsied nodule or if there is no possible match, report the matched radiology report nodule as "Unknown"
      - Step 3. If there is only one possible match, report the matched radiology report nodule.
      - Step 4. Evaluate your matching and report the confidence level of your decision as "Low" or "High"

  Process 7. **Structure the Output in YAML:**
  - The final output should be a YAML document with a top-level keys are "radiology_report_nodules", "biopsy_report_nodules", "biopsy_report_lymph_nodes". "nodule_matching"
  - Use exactly the field names and structure as the example shown below.
  - If some categories cannot be found, report as "Unknown"
  - Echogenicity and Composition can cantain prepositions or adjectives
  - Shape has a strict output options ["taller-than-wide, "wider-than-tall", "Unknown"]
  - Margin has a stict output options ["smooth", "ill-defined", "lobulated", "irregular", "irregular or lobulated", "extra-thyroidal extension", "Unknown".]
  - Size should report the largest dimension
  - Only Report TI-RADS Score if it is directly mentioned in the radiology report with in numerical value (between 1-5)
  - Nodule ID should always be numerical. Convert Alphabet ID to corresponding numerical ID. (e.g. 'A' to '1', 'B' to '2')

          matching_confidence: 'Low'

  Do not modify the information when extracting them from the reports and extract as is from the reports.
