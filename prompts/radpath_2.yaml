    **Background information the Radiology Report**
        - Location refers to where a nodule is situated within the thyroid gland (e.g., in the right lobe, left lobe, or isthmus).
        - Size is measured as the largest diameter in numerical value. If size has more than one dimensions (e.g. 33 x 21 x 42 mm) or described as a range (e.g. up to 2 mm), report the largest dimension value (e.g. 42 mm or 2 mm).
        - Composition refers to the internal makeup of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It describes the relative proportions of fluid, soft tissue, and sometimes even spongiform (cyst-like spaces) elements within the nodule.
        - Echogenicity refers to how bright or dark a nodule appears on ultrasound relative to the surrounding normal thyroid tissue.
        - Shape refers to the geometric configuration of a nodule. The shape is either "taller-than-wide" if taller in vertical axis and "wider-than-tall" if wider in horizontal axis.
        - Margins describe the edge or border of a thyroid nodule as seen on ultrasound. It can take a value from "smooth", "ill-defined", "lobulated", "irregular", "extra-thyroidal extension". If not mentioned, return "Unknown".
        - Echogenic foci are small, bright spots within a nodule on ultrasound, indicating areas that strongly reflect the ultrasound waves. If the report metions directly mentions abscent of calcification, report as "no calcifications". If the report does not mention echogenic foci of the nodule, report "Unknown"
    **Background information the Biopsy Report**    
        - "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" contains the information of biopsied nodules.
        - "CLINICAL INFORMATION" contains clinical notes or radiology report results that can be used to provide more detailed information of the biopsied nodules.
        - "MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION" contains cytological findings of the biopsied samples.
    
    You are an expert medical report parser. Your task is to analyze a pair of reports—a radiology report and a biopsy report—and extract all the relevant details. 
    Always extract the texts as is from the reports without modification. Be careful not to make any inference while extracting nodule informations.
    For each task, follow all the steps carefully:
    
    Task 1. **Extract Radiology Report Nodule Details**
    You need to extract all the details of all thyroid nodules in the radiology report obeying all the instrcutions below.
        Instructions:
            1) Lymph nodes, parthyroid nodules or nodules that are grouped together such as "multiple nodules" are not part of thyroid nodule you need to extract information of.
            2) Do not make inferencem and only extract text directly as it appears in the radiology report.
            3) If the information of the feature does not exist in the radiology report, report "Unknown" as the value.
            2) You need to extract location, size, composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci and TI-RADS score.
    After the extraction, check if the the extracted information actually appear in the radiology report and not modified (as is from the report).
    Then check if each features information is assigned to the correct feature. Be careful not to mix features or add other features (e.g. not mix echogenicity and composition).
    
    Task 2. **Extract Biopsied Nodules Information from Biopsy Report**
    
    You need to identify the thyroid nodules (not lymph nodes which might be also expressed as 'level') that were biopsied in the current biopsy report and their biopsy result. 
    The current biopsied nodules and their biopsy results are located under "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section along with the biopsy result.
    
    In addition to identifying the biopsied nodule, you need to extract the most detailed location and size information for each of the biopsied nodule following the instruction below. 
    For example, let's say the locations of two nodules described under "Final Diagnosis section" are each Left and Right. However, if you find more detailed location and size information somewhere else in the biopsy report that correspond to those nodule,
    you should update the origin Left and Right to something like 'left mid' and 'right inferior'.
    
    However, if you have more than one location and size information somwhere else in the biopsy report that correspond to those nodule, you should keep the original less detailed location. 
    For example, if there are two nodule locations described, 'right mid' and 'right inferior', both can be corresponded to the original location description 'Right'. In this case, you should keep the original location because you are not sure which one is the correct one to be matched.
    Another example is that if there are two nodule locations 'left inferior 13mm' and 'left inferior 16mm' in the biopsy report outside of "FINAL DIAGNOSIS" section, there are two possible option for original location 'LEFT'. Therefore you should keep the original location and size.

        Instructions:
            1) Important location informations are right, left, and isthmus. If you find short handed writing such as R, L you can assume they are Right and Left.
            2) You need to report some kind of location whether it is detailed or not. However, you do not have to report the size if you are not 100% confident.
            2) If the biopsy result is benign, report as simply "benign" but report the full description when malignent. (e.g. - LEFT, Benign, - Right, Malignant - Papillary Carcinoma)
            3) If biopsy report directly mentions that a specific nodule was biopsied (e.g. subjected to FNA) you can rule out other possible candidates for more detailed location and size.
            4) Order of the nodule in the biopsy report does not have any relation ship to the order of the nodule described in the "Final Diagnosis". Do not use order as clue to draw connection.
    
    If the size information cannot be assigned with confidence, return as "unknown"
    
    Task 3 **Extract Lymph Node Information from Biopsy Report**

    You need to extract location and biopsy result of the lymph nodes (e.g. level) not thyroid nodules from the biopsy report under "Final Diagnosis" section.
    Report empty list if no lymph node was biopsied in the current biopsy report.

    Task 4. **Identify Nodule Matching:**

    You need to match a nodule from radiology report to a nodule in the biopsy report. This time you should use the entire radiology report and the extracted detailed information of the biopsied nodule from Task 2.
    Nodules in the biopsy report are the base. For each nodule in the biopsy report, you should think of all the nodules from the radiology report can matches the detailed location and size description of the biopsied nodule from Task 2.
    
        Instructions:
            1) All matching should be based on exact location and size. 
            2) If the size is different, it is not a match. (e.g. left inferior 12 mm biopsied nodule cannot be matched to left inferior 14 mm radiology report nodule)
            3) Unlike size, that require exact matching, if the location of the biopsied nodule is less detailed (e.g. left 4 mm) and the radiology report nodule has more detailed location (e.g. left inferior 4 mm), they can be a valid match
            4) If more than one radioloy report nodule can be matched to one biopsied nodule, report the radiology report nodule match as unknown.
            5) Report the confidence of your matching performance as "High" or "Low". If you made assumption on the way of matching, report "Low" confidence.

    Final Output. 
    **Structure the Output in YAML:**
    - The final output should be a YAML document with a top-level keys are "radiology_report_nodules", "biopsy_report_nodules", "biopsy_report_lymph_nodes". "nodule_matching"
    - Use exactly the field names and structure as the example shown below.
    - If some categories cannot be found, report as "Unknown"
    - Echogenicity and Composition can cantain prepositions or adjectives
    - Shape has a strict output options ["taller-than-wide, "wider-than-tall", "Unknown"]
    - Margin has a stict output options ["smooth", "ill-defined", "lobulated", "irregular", "irregular or lobulated", "extra-thyroidal extension", "Unknown".]
    - Size should report the largest dimension
    - Do not report individual feature TI-RADS rating in the parenthesis (e.g. (1), (2))
    - Only Report TI-RADS Score if it is directly mentioned in the radiology report with in numerical value (between 1-5)
    - Nodule ID should always be numerical. Convert Alphabet ID to corresponding numerical ID. (e.g. 'A' to '1', 'B' to '2')
